### Hello World 👋

Hi there! I'm Dan, somebody who's just trying to get through this crazy world while some having fun and learning a thing or two along the way. I'm a software engineer by profession, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I want to make a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that.

### Quick Facts ⏩

* Website: <https://www.danstarner.com>
* Blog: <https://dev.to/dstarner>
* LinkedIn (w/ resume): <https://www.linkedin.com/in/danstarner/>
* Pronouns: He/Him
* Fun Fact: My go-to lunch is an Italian sub on wheat with balsalmic, lettuce, tomato, onion, and alllllll the cold cuts available. 🥪

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ☠️

So it seems as though you found my GitHub profile! That's exciting for you, and scary for me, seeing as a far amount of this profile is graveyard projects from college. No worries! Feel free to look around still - I can't stop you - but remember that **much of this code was written was I was just a student**. Most of my newer code is proprietary (for the moment) so I can't really share it, but feel free to read the sections below on what I'm focusing on.

### Say Hi 📫

Honestly, the best way to reach out to me is probably either via a Direct Message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_starner) or to just @ me in a tweet you think is cool! Feel free to email me as well, but I'm a Gen-Z'er, so I (albeit regrettably) am most likely on social media, so I'll see the Twitter mentions first.

I'll chat about technology, racing, video games, interviewing/resumes, Legos, or really whatever you want! I enjoy sharing my experiences, but I enjoy hearing others' personal journeys and opinions more.

### What have I been up to?

#### Current Projects 👨‍💻

I am helping to build the infrastructure that powers [@heroku](https://github.com/heroku/), which is really neat because I get to give back to other developers in a similar way that Heroku helped me first get started with web deployments. More specifically, I am working with the runtime infrastructure that ensures your dynos stay healthy and happy!
