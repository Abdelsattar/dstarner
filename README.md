### Hello World 👋

Hi there! I'm Dan, somebody who's just trying to get through this crazy world while some having fun and learning a thing or two along the way. I'm a software engineer by profession, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I want to make a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that.

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ☠️

So it seems as though you found my GitHub profile! That's exciting for you, and scary for me, seeing as a far amount of this profile is graveyard projects from college. No worries! Feel free to look around still - I can't stop you - but remember that much of this code was written was I was just a novice. Most of my newer code is proprietary (for the moment) so I can't really share it, but feel free to read the sections below on what I'm focusing on.

### Say Hi 📫

Honestly, the best way to reach out to me is probably either via a Direct Message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/standarner) or to just @ me in a tweet you think is cool! Feel free to email me as well, but I'm a Gen-Z'er, so I (albeit regrettably) on social media, so I'll probably see the Twitter mentions first.

I'll chat about technology, racing, video games, interviewing/resumes, Legos, or really whatever you want! I enjoy sharing my experiences, but I enjoy hearing others' personal journeys and opinions more.
